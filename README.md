This project simulates a trading strategy that buys and sells Bitcoin using leveraged positions (e.g., 10x, 100x). An AI model provides buy/sell signals based on historical features such as price movements, volume, RSI, or other technical indicators. The system evaluates the strategyâ€™s performance on past BTC data to estimate profit, risk, and volatility.
